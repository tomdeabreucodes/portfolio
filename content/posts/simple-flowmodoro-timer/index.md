## Demo

A simple timer app to help you achieve and maintain flow state.

## Motivation

I'd previously tested out several pomodoro timers shortly after stumbling across the technique. There are several highly polished apps in this category, including free ones which are feature-rich. My issue was with the technique itself. I simply couldn't become productive with this technique due to the rigid time allocations for the pomodoros and breaks. This is not a unique problem and has long been solved by the variant of the technique coined the flowtime technique a.k.a. flowmodoro. 

There are far less flowmodoro timers due to it being more niche, so I decided to make one which suited my requirements and had a more minimal, sleek UI than the current offerings.

## What is 'Flowmodoro'?

- Flowmodoro is a more flexible variant of the Pomodoro Technique, optimising for achieving and maintaining a flow state.
- Instead of leveraging focus sessions and breaks with fixed times, you decide when the focus session ends once you feel like you need a break.
- The break time is then calculated, proportionate to the length of the focus session (In other words, the longer the focus session, the longer the break).
- Crucially, the technique also emphasises the importance of unitasking. Pick one task which will remain your focus until you can check it off. Break it down into smaller sub-tasks if needed.
